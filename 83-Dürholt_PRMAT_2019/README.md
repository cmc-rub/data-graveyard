Dürholt and R. Schmid, _Phys. Rev. Materials_, **2019**, 3, 094408, DOI: [10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.094408](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.094408)

This paper was posted as a [preprint on chemRxiv](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.7718633.v1)

Here input files for performing the NVT and NPT simulations with [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/) are provided. The system was simulated always starting from the ferroelectric phase using a 3x3x3 supercell of the structure provided by the [materials project.](https://doi.org/10.17188/1204127)
