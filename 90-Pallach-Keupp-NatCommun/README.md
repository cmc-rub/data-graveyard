# Supporting Data

Supporting data for `<full citation to be added here soon>`

These folders contain:
* the force field parameters in our in-house developed `.ric`. and `.par` file format aswell as in `.in` and `.data` file format to run LAMMPS without our in-house [pylmps](https://github.com/MOFplus/pylmps) wrapper. 
* the initial structures used for all simulations
* the python scripts that drive the simulations, or alternatively the lammps input commands `.in`, `.data` and `.lmps` to drive the simulations without the pylmps wrapper.

The codes necessary to run using the cmc software can be obtained upon reasonable request at rochus.schmid[at]rub.de
