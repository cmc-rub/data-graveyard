## Pressure ramp NPT simulations

These folder contain the input to run the pressure ramp NPT simulations. In-house we run it via the `Pramp_NPT.py` script, which requires our in-house developed [pylmps](https://github.com/MOFplus/pylmps) package. Access will be granted upon reasonable request to rochus.schmid [at] rub.de. Alternatively, the lammps commands to run the simulations are given in the .lmps files
