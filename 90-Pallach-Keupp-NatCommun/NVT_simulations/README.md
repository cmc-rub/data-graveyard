## NVT Simulations

These folder contain the input to run the $NV(\sigma_{a}=0)T$ simulations. In-house we run it via the `run_NVs0T.py` script, which requires our in-house developed [pylmps](https://github.com/MOFplus/pylmps) package. Access will be granted upon reasonable request to rochus.schmid [at] rub.de. Alternatively, the lammps commands to run the simulations without using our code are are given in the .lmps files.

The folders also contain the averaged results obtained from the simulations as `VPUdata.csv`. The Volume of the simulation cell is given in cubic angstroms, the pressure in bar and the total energy in kcal/mol.
