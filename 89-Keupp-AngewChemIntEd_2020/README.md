The folders contain:
* the initial structures used for the NPT simulations
* the force field parameters in our in-house developed `.ric`. and `.par` file format aswell as in `.in` and `.data` file format to run LAMMPS without our in-house [pylmps](https://github.com/MOFplus/pylmps) wrapper. 
* the python scripts that drive the simulations
