Data from the CMC group
==

This repository hosts the scientific data produced by the [Computational Materials Chemistry group](http://www.rochusschmid.de). These are files related to our published papers: additional supporting information, molecular simulation input files, analysis codes, raw data, etc.

You can browse above the directories corresponding to each paper. The numbering is the same as on the group's [publication list](http://cmc.aci.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/cmc/publications/overview).

If you use the data in these files, please cite the relevant paper. If you think some data is missing, or have any question, please contact the corresponding author for that paper, or [R. Schmid](http://cmc.aci.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/cmc/people/rochusschmid).

This repository is inspired by the [citeable-data](https://github.com/fxcoudert/citable-data) repository from the [Coudert research group.](https://www.coudert.name/)
